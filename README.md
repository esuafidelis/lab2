# In this laboratory work, I have built, trained and evaluated models of several types that determine whether a person has breast cancer or not. The following steps were taken during the work:
  - a pipeline was built for preprocessing (filling gaps and scaling) data
  - the input data was divided into labels and parameters, and later into two samples - training and test
  - built pipeline for training
  - cross-validation was carried out to determine the best hyperparameter
  - the models were evaluated using various parameters

As a result, the resulting model cannot boast of accuracy, which completely coincides with the conclusions about the initial data in the first laboratory work.
